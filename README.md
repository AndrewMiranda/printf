**objective:** This project creates our own version, _printf, of the C library function printf. Printf formats data and converts it to a character string and outputs to stdout, applying variadic functions, structures and function pointers.

we will use authorized functions and macros like:
>- [x] write (man 2 writes)
>- [x] malloc (male 3 malloc)
>- [x] free (man 3 free)
>- [x] va_start (man 3 va_start)
>- [x] va_end (man 3 va_end)
>- [x] va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
>- [x] va_arg (man 3 va_arg)
